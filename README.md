**The self-improving AI agent.** It's the only agent with a built-in learning loop — it creates skills from experience, improves them during use, nudges itself to persist knowledge, searches its own past conversations, and builds a deepening model of who you are across sessions. Run it on a $5 VPS, a GPU cluster, or serverless infrastructure that costs nearly nothing when idle. It's not tied to your laptop — talk to it from Telegram while it works on a cloud VM.

Use any model you want — OpenRouter, OpenAI, your own endpoint, and many others. Switch with `hermes model` — no code changes, no lock-in.

<table>
<tr><td><b>A real terminal interface</b></td><td>Full TUI with multiline editing, slash-command autocomplete, conversation history, interrupt-and-redirect, and streaming tool output.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Lives where you do</b></td><td>Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, and CLI — all from a single gateway process. Voice memo transcription, cross-platform conversation continuity.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>A closed learning loop</b></td><td>Agent-curated memory with periodic nudges. Autonomous skill creation after complex tasks. Skills self-improve during use. FTS5 session search with LLM summarization for cross-session recall. Compatible with the <a href="https://agentskills.io">agentskills.io</a> open standard.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Scheduled automations</b></td><td>Built-in cron scheduler with delivery to any platform. Daily reports, nightly backups, weekly audits — all in natural language, running unattended.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Delegates and parallelizes</b></td><td>Spawn isolated subagents for parallel workstreams. Write Python scripts that call tools via RPC, collapsing multi-step pipelines into zero-context-cost turns.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Runs anywhere, not just your laptop</b></td><td>Six terminal backends — local, Docker, SSH, Singularity, Modal, and Daytona. Daytona and Modal offer serverless persistence — your agent's environment hibernates when idle and wakes on demand, costing nearly nothing between sessions. Run it on a $5 VPS or a GPU cluster.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Research-ready</b></td><td>Batch trajectory generation, trajectory compression for training the next generation of tool-calling models.</td></tr>

## Quick Install

### Windows (native, PowerShell)

Run this in PowerShell:

```powershell
iex (irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S1d11/zeus/main/scripts/install.ps1)
```

Or download the **[Windows installer](https://github.com/S1d11/zeus/releases/latest)** from the Releases page — it includes everything you need (Python, Node.js, ripgrep, ffmpeg, and a portable Git Bash).

### Linux, macOS, WSL2, Termux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S1d11/zeus/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

The installer handles everything: uv, Python 3.11, Node.js, ripgrep, ffmpeg, **and a portable Git Bash** (MinGit, unpacked to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\git` — no admin required, completely isolated from any system Git install). Hermes uses this bundled Git Bash to run shell commands.

If you already have Git installed, the installer detects it and uses that instead. Otherwise a ~45MB MinGit download is all you need — it won't touch or interfere with any system Git.

After installation:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc    # reload shell (or: source ~/.zshrc)
hermes              # start chatting!
```

### Desktop App

Download the latest **[Hermes Desktop](https://github.com/S1d11/zeus/releases/latest)** installer for Windows. The desktop app provides a full GUI with chat, settings, MCP server management, connections, and auto-updates.

## Getting Started

```bash
hermes              # Interactive CLI — start a conversation
hermes model        # Choose your LLM provider and model
hermes tools        # Configure which tools are enabled
hermes config set   # Set individual config values
hermes gateway      # Start the messaging gateway (Telegram, Discord, etc.)
hermes setup        # Run the full setup wizard (configures everything at once)
hermes update       # Update to the latest version
hermes doctor       # Diagnose any issues
```

---

## CLI vs Messaging Quick Reference

Hermes has two entry points: start the terminal UI with `hermes`, or run the gateway and talk to it from Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, or Email. Once you're in a conversation, many slash commands are shared across both interfaces.

| Action                         | CLI                                           | Messaging platforms                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Start chatting                 | `hermes`                                      | Run `hermes gateway setup` + `hermes gateway start`, then send the bot a message |
| Start fresh conversation       | `/new` or `/reset`                            | `/new` or `/reset`                                                               |

| Set a personality              | `/personality [name]`                         | `/personality [name]`                                                            |
| Retry or undo the last turn    | `/retry`, `/undo`                             | `/retry`, `/undo`                                                                |
| Compress context / check usage | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [--days N]` | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [days]`                                        |
| Browse skills                  | `/skills` or `/<skill-name>`                  | `/<skill-name>`                                                                  |
| Interrupt current work         | `Ctrl+C` or send a new message                | `/stop` or send a new message                                                    |
| Platform-specific status       | `/platforms`                                  | `/status`, `/sethome`                                                            |

## Migrating from OpenClaw

If you're coming from OpenClaw, Hermes can automatically import your settings, memories, skills, and API keys.

**During first-time setup:** The setup wizard (`hermes setup`) automatically detects `~/.openclaw` and offers to migrate before configuration begins.

**Anytime after install:**

```bash
hermes claw migrate              # Interactive migration (full preset)
hermes claw migrate --dry-run    # Preview what would be migrated
hermes claw migrate --preset user-data   # Migrate without secrets
hermes claw migrate --overwrite  # Overwrite existing conflicts
```

What gets imported:

- **SOUL.md** — persona file
- **Memories** — MEMORY.md and USER.md entries
- **Skills** — user-created skills → `~/.hermes/skills/openclaw-imports/`
- **API keys** — provider keys from `.env`

---

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/S1d11/zeus.git
cd hermes/hermes-agent
source .venv/bin/activate   # or: source venv/bin/activate
scripts/run_tests.sh
```

Manual clone fallback (for throwaway clones/CI where you intentionally do not
want the managed install layout):

Create the venv outside the cloned source tree — a venv inside the directory
the agent operates from can be wiped by a relative-path command the agent runs
against its own checkout, destroying the running runtime mid-session.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv venv ~/.hermes/venvs/hermes-dev --python 3.11
source ~/.hermes/venvs/hermes-dev/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[all,dev]"
scripts/run_tests.sh
```
